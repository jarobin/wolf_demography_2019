# Simulations of deleterious variation in gray wolves

Demographic model and simulation details are in "Genomic signatures of extensive inbreeding in Isle Royale wolves, a population on the threshold of extinction" by Robinson et al. (2019).

### Script for forward simulations of neutral and deleterious variation in a large (i.e. North American mainland wolves) and a smaller (i.e. Tibetan wolves) population in SLiM (Haller and Messer, 2016).
- `make_submit_slim_wolf.job.sh` makes a SLIM script in the Eidos language given a set of specified parameters, and then submits the job.
